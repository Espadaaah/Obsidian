There are several steps that can be taken to mitigate the risk of broken access control vulnerabilities in PHP applications:

1. **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. By defining roles in an organization and assigning access rights to these roles, you can control what actions a user can perform on a system. The provided code snippet illustrates how you can define roles (such as ‘admin’, ‘editor’, or ‘user’) and the permissions associated with them. The `hasPermission` function checks if a user of a certain role has a specified permission.
```
// Define roles and permissions
	$roles = [
		'admin' => ['create', 'read', 'update', 'delete'], 
		'editor' => ['create', 'read', 'update'], 
		'user' => ['read'],
	];
	
// Check user permissions
	function hasPermission($userRole, $requiredPermission) { 
		global $roles; 
		return in_array($requiredPermission, $roles[$userRole]); 
	}
	
// Example usage
