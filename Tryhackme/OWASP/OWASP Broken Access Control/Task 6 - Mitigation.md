There are several steps that can be taken to mitigate the risk of broken access control vulnerabilities in PHP applications:

1. **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. By defining roles in an organization and assigning access rights to these roles, you can control what actions a user can perform on a system. The provided code snippet illustrates how you can define roles (such as ‘admin’, ‘editor’, or ‘user’) and the permissions associated with them. The `hasPermission` function checks if a user of a certain role has a specified permission.
```
// Define roles and permissions
$roles = [
	'admin' => ['create', 'read', 'update', 'delete'], 
	'editor' => ['create', 'read', 'update'], 
	'user' => ['read'],
];
	
// Check user permissions
function hasPermission($userRole, $requiredPermission) { 
	global $roles; 
	return in_array($requiredPermission, $roles[$userRole]); 
}
	
// Example usage
if (hasPermission('admin', 'delete')) { 
	// Allow delete operation 
} else { 
	// Deny delete operation 
}
```

2. **Use Parameterized Queries**: Parameterized queries are a way to protect PHP applications from SQL Injection attacks, where malicious users could potentially gain unauthorized access to your database. By using placeholders instead of directly including user input into the SQL query, you can significantly reduce the risk of SQL Injection attacks. The provided example demonstrates how a query can be made secure using prepared statements, which separates SQL syntax from data and handles user input safely.
```
// Example of vulnerable query
$username = $_POST['username']; 
$password = $_POST['password']; 
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='$username' AND password='$password'";

// Example of secure query using prepared statements
$username = $_POST['username']; 
$password = $_POST['password']; 
$stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=? AND password=?"); 
$stmt->execute([$username, $password]); 
$user = $stmt->fetch();
```

3. **Proper Session Management**: Proper session management ensures that authenticated users have timely and appropriate access to resources, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information. Session management includes using secure cookies, setting session timeouts, and limiting the number of active sessions a user can have. The code snippet shows how to initialize a session, set session variables and check for session validity by looking at the last activity time.
```
// Start session
	session_start();
	
// Set session variables
	$_SESSION['user_id'] = $user_id; 
	$_SESSION['last_activity'] = time();

// Check if session is still valid
if (isset($_SESSION['last_activity']) && (time() - $_SESSION['last_activity'] > 1800)) {

	// Session has expired
	session_unset(); 
	session_destroy(); 
}
```

4. **Use Secure Coding Practices**: Secure coding practices involve methods to prevent the introduction of security vulnerabilities. Developers should sanitize and validate user input to prevent malicious data from causing harm and avoid using insecure functions or libraries. The given example shows how to sanitize user input using PHP’s `filter_input` function and demonstrates how to securely hash a password using `password_hash` instead of an insecure function like `md5`.
