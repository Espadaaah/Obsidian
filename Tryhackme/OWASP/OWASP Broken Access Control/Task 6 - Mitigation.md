There are several steps that can be taken to mitigate the risk of broken access control vulnerabilities in PHP applications:

1. **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. By defining roles in an organization and assigning access rights to these roles, you can control what actions a user can perform on a system. The provided code snippet illustrates how you can define roles (such as ‘admin’, ‘editor’, or ‘user’) and the permissions associated with them. The `hasPermission` function checks if a user of a certain role has a specified permission.
```
// Define roles and permissions
	$roles = [
		'admin' => ['create', 'read', 'update', 'delete'], 
		'editor' => ['create', 'read', 'update'], 
		'user' => ['read'],
	];
	
// Check user permissions
	function hasPermission($userRole, $requiredPermission) { 
		global $roles; 
		return in_array($requiredPermission, $roles[$userRole]); 
	}
	
// Example usage
	if (hasPermission('admin', 'delete')) { 
		// Allow delete operation 
	} else { 
		// Deny delete operation 
	}
```

2. **Use Parameterized Queries**: Parameterized queries are a way to protect PHP applications from SQL Injection attacks, where malicious users could potentially gain unauthorized access to your database. By using placeholders instead of directly including user input into the SQL query, you can significantly reduce the risk of SQL Injection attacks. The provided example demonstrates how a query can be made secure using prepared statements, which separates SQL syntax from data and handles user input safely.
```
// Example of vulnerable query
	$username = $_POST['username']; $password = $_POST['password']; $query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='$username' AND password='$password'";
```
