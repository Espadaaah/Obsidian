Recall that since this is about known vulnerabilities, most of the work has already been done for us. Our main job is to find out the information of the software and research it until we can find an exploit. Let's go through that with an example web application.

![Nostromo version](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/79310c575c9809b1ac8e8546badb2d34.png)  

_Nostromo 1.9.6_  

What do you know? This server has the default page for the Nostromo web server. Now that we have a version number and a software name, we can use [Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/) to try and find an exploit for this particular version.

Lucky us, the top result happens to be an exploit script. Let's download it and try to get code execution. Running this script on its own teaches us a very important lesson.
