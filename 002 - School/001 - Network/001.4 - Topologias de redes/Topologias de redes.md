## Barramento (BUS)

![](Imagens/BUS.png)

- Todos os nodes estão interligados pelo cabo de backbone
- Só uma comunicação em simultâneo. Se falhar os outros não são afetados
- Pouca escalabilidade, sendo apenas adequada a pequenas redes
- Pouca segurança e performance, e difícil de fazer troubleshooting

### Mesh Total
- All the nodes within the network are connected with every other If there are n number of nodes during a network, each node will have an n-1 number of connections. A full mesh provides an excellent deal of redundancy, but because it is expensive to implement, it's usually reserved for network backbones.

### Mesh Parcial
- The partial mesh is more practical as compared to the full mesh. In a partially connected mesh, all the nodes aren't necessary to be connected with one another during a network. Peripheral networks are connected using partial mesh topology.

### Applications of Mesh Topology

Below mentioned are some of the applications of Mesh Topology:

- ***Wireless Networks:*** Many homes and small office spaces uses Mesh Wifi System for better internet coverage and connectivity.
- ***Industrial and Manufacturing Networks:*** Many industries uses mesh topology to control machinery, ensuring better productivity.
- ***Smart Homes:** Some advanced homes also use mesh topology for connecting home appliances like smart lights, security systems, etc.
- ***Military Communication:*** Mesh Topology are used in Military Purposes as if one connection fails, then there is always a chance of another connection.
