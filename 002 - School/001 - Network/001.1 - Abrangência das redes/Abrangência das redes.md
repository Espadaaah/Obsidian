## LAN - Local Area Network

## Types of LAN

There are different architectures in LAN as discussed below:

- ***Client/Server LANs:*** Multiple devices (the clients) are connected to a main server in a client/server LAN. The server controls network traffic, device access, application access, and file storage. Any connected device that runs apps or accesses the Internet qualifies as a client. Clients can use wired or wireless connections to connect to the server.
- ***Peer-to-Peer LANs:*** Peer-to-peer LANs are commonly smaller because they shortage a central server and can't support huge workloads like client/server LANs can. Every device on a peer-to-peer LAN collaborates equally to the network's operation. Through wired or wireless connections to a switch or router, the devices share data and resources. Peer-to-peer networks are the norm in homes.
- ***Ethernet:*** It is most widely used architecture. ethernet specifies the network speed, cable type and network interface adapters. This type of architecture used in both wired or wireless networks.
- ***Token ring:*** Token ring is a type of local area network (LAN) setup that was once widely used but is now less common. It manages network access through the use of tokens and has an operating speed of 100 megabits per second.
- ***Cloud-managed:*** A cloud-managed LAN depend on a centralized cloud service to handle tasks such as access control, policy enforcement, network setup, and various security and performance issues. This approach simplifies management in diverse network environments, making it ideal for businesses.

## Differences Between Wired LAN, Wireless LAN and Virtual LAN

### Wired LAN

A wired LAN connects devices like, servers, IoT devices, and other electronic devices to a company network using switches and Ethernet cables. For small organization, or businesses with a limited number of devices, a wired LAN might just consist of a single, unmanaged switch with Ethernet ports to connect all the devices.

### Wireless LAN

A wireless LAN allows devices to connect to the network without physical cables. Wireless LAN or WLANs transfer data over radio waves using wireless technology. This type of LAN is commonly found in homes, offices, coffee shops, and restaurants where mobility is important. WLANs enable devices such as computers, smartphones, and tablets to connect to the internet or other shared resources. For example connecting mobile to the hotspot is a wireless LAN.

Wireless LANs use the IEEE 802.11 standards to transmit data between devices and the network through the wireless system. In many cases, WLANs are preferred over wired LANs due to their flexibility and cost efficiency, as they eliminate the need for extensive cabling. Businesses considering WLANs as their main form of connectivity often have users who primarily depend on mobile devices like smartphones and tablets.

### Virtual LAN

In larger LANs that connect thousands of devices, more hardware, software, and configuration are needed to maintain optimal network performance. This is where virtual LANs (VLANs) become useful.

## MAN - Metropolitan Area Network



## ****Characteristics of MAN****

- It covers an area from 5 km to 50 km which can cover a city.
- MAN is owned by a group of users rather than a single company.
- MAN provides high speed network which uses shared regional resources.
- Size of MAN is in between WAN and LAN.
- In MAN, data rates are moderate to high.
- MAN networks provides high reliability because the error rate in this network is very less.
- A MAN network can use a variety of access technologies, such as wireless, [fiber-optic](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/fiber-optics-and-types/), or copper-based connections, to provide connectivity to different devices and networks.

## ****Advantages of MAN****

- MAN covers a larger area than LAN.
- It has less implementation cost and it uses less resources.
- It provides higher security than [WAN.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-science-fundamentals/wan-full-form/)
- It can cover area as large as a city.
- MAN is a faster way to connect two fast LANs together.
- In some installation of MANs, users can share their internet connection. So multiple users can get the same high-speed internet.

## ****Disadvantages of MAN****

- MAN is not easily manageable as it becomes very complex.
- It requires highly skilled people to look after it.
- It requires more cables for connecting the LAN's.
- It has high management cost
- It covers smaller area than WAN.
- It is only used in metropolitan areas.

### ****Examples of MAN****

- Digital cable television
- Used in government agencies
- Used to connect several branches of the local school
- A network of fire stations
- University campuses
- Networking between community colleges within the country
- Cable broadband
