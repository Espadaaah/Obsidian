## Types of LAN

There are different architectures in LAN as discussed below:

- ***Client/Server LANs:*** Multiple devices (the clients) are connected to a main server in a client/server LAN. The server controls network traffic, device access, application access, and file storage. Any connected device that runs apps or accesses the Internet qualifies as a client. Clients can use wired or wireless connections to connect to the server.
- ***Peer-to-Peer LANs:*** [Peer-to-peer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/what-is-p2p-peer-to-peer-process/) LANs are commonly smaller because they shortage a central server and can't support huge workloads like client/server LANs can. Every device on a peer-to-peer LAN collaborates equally to the network's operation. Through wired or wireless connections to a switch or router, the devices share data and resources. Peer-to-peer networks are the norm in homes.
- ***Ethernet:*** It is most widely used architecture. ethernet specifies the network speed, cable type and network interface adapters. This type of architecture used in both wired or wireless networks.
- ***Token ring:*** Token ring is a type of local area network (LAN) setup that was once widely used but is now less common. It manages network access through the use of tokens and has an operating speed of 100 megabits per second.
- ***Cloud-managed:*** A cloud-managed LAN depend on a centralized cloud service to handle tasks such as access control, policy enforcement, network setup, and various security and performance issues. This approach simplifies management in diverse network environments, making it ideal for businesses.
